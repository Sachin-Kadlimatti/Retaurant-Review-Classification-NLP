 restaurant and also overall review of the restaurant. The Project uses 5 models namely i) Multinomial Naive Bayes ii) Logistic Regression 
Model iii) Random Forest Classifier iv) Decision Tree Classifier v) Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classifying the reviews and 
the best classification model is chosen The classified reviews are helpful for the restaurant to analyze their shortcomings improve
